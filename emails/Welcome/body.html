        <p>Dear Martin</p>
<p>Welcome to my mail !!!</p>

<p>
        The emails used in the role play session are tailored to the given scenario.  <br>
        The URL links in the given email client will only pop up a message and will not direct you to the actual location. <br>
        Here is an example of such a <a href="http://google.com">URL</a></u> <span class="primaryurl"> (http://google.com) </span> </span>
        <br>Also, all the buttons (e.g. reply, forward) in the  email client are  inactive to prevent you from mistakenly replying or forwarding the emails. <br>
        So you are free to interact with anything on the interface as you normally would do and it is absolutely safe to do so. 
    
</p>


<p>Thanks,
</p>
